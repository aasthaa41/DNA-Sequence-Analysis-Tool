# DNA Sequence Analysis Tool

The DNA Sequence Analysis Tool is a bioinformatics application designed to facilitate the analysis of DNA sequences. This tool leverages biopython , apowerful library for biological computation, to provide functionalities such as reading fasta sequence ,calculating GC content, finding open reading frames(ORFs),identifying motifs, translating DNA sequence into protein sequence.

# Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need the Biopython library to be installed. Open source library to facilitate biological computation in python programming language.

# Dataset
Using DK977596 full-length enriched swallowtail butterfly cDNA library, late pupae fore-leg tarsus Papilio xuthus cDNA clone PxutEST_ftfRN27h09 5', mRNA sequence.

# Results
The tool effectively analyzes the DNA sequence, providing valuable information about its structure and potential protein-coding regions. The result helps to understand the genetic makeup and functional elements within the sequence.
